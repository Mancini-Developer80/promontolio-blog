      <h1>Our Heritage</h1>
      <p>
        Nestled on Apulia’s sun-drenched slopes, our family has harvested olives
        for generations. Each grove whispers tales of ancestral hands, sea
        breezes, and limestone soils that shape our oil’s character. We honor
        this lineage by preserving traditional methods passed down through
        centuries.
